A time series is a sequence of observed data, measured or recorded at regular intervals over time. 
These data are organized in a chronological sequence and are used to analyze patterns, trends, and variations that may occur as a function of time. 
Time series are applied in various fields such as economics, finance, meteorology, epidemiology, and engineering, among others, to study behavior and forecast future values based on historical data.
